Description: Write a program to play a sticks game in which there are 16 sticks. 
             Two players take turns to play the game. 
             Each player picks one set of sticks (neednâ€™t be adjacent) during his turn. 
             A set contains 1, 2, or 3 sticks. 
             The player who takes the last stick is the loser. 
             The number of sticks in the set is to be input.
